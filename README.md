# Flutter Integration of OAuth 2.0 with PKCE

This project demonstrates the integration of OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) in a Flutter application, allowing already registered users to authorize and gain access to a Laravel backend.

## Laravel Backend

The Flutter app is designed to work with a Laravel backend implementing OAuth 2.0 with PKCE. You can find the Laravel backend setup here: [Laravel backend](https://github.com/BradDoesCode/laravel-passport-experimentation).

## Getting Started

This project serves as a starting point for integrating OAuth 2.0 with PKCE in Flutter applications. It is aimed at developers looking to better understand the workflow of OAuth 2.0. This application is not a full package. It will only handle already registered users and does not handle saving any access tokens. Errors are also not being handled. If you want a full package then you can find one here: [Flutter_appAuth](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_appauth)

### Requirements

To run this project, you will need:
- A Flutter environment set up on your machine.
- The Laravel backend from the provided GitHub link up and running.

### Features
